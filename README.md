# Python Screenshot Project

This project is a Python-based tool that allows users to capture screenshots programmatically using the `pyscreenshot` library. The tool can be used for automating the process of taking screenshots in various contexts, such as testing applications, monitoring screen content, or capturing specific areas of the screen.

## Features

- Capture the full screen or a specific area
- Save screenshots in multiple formats (PNG, JPEG, etc.)
- Simple and lightweight with minimal dependencies

## Requirements

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- `pyscreenshot` library

You can install the required Python packages with the following command:

```bash
pip install pyscreenshot
```

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/screenshot-project.git
cd screenshot-project
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

The script allows you to take screenshots using the `pyscreenshot` library.

### Capturing the Entire Screen

To capture the entire screen, you can use the following command:

```python
import pyscreenshot as ImageGrab

# Capture the full screen
image = ImageGrab.grab()

# Save the image
image.save("screenshot.png")
```

### Capturing a Specific Area

To capture a specific region of the screen, define the coordinates:

```python
import pyscreenshot as ImageGrab

# Define the bounding box (x1, y1, x2, y2)
bbox = (10, 10, 500, 500)

# Capture the defined region
image = ImageGrab.grab(bbox=bbox)

# Save the image
image.save("region_screenshot.png")
```

## Running the Script

You can run the script directly from the terminal:

```bash
python screenshot.py
```

Modify the script according to your requirements, such as saving the file to a specific path or defining custom regions for capturing.
